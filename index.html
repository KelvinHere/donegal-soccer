            <p>
                Drumbar United FC is a soccer club based on the outskirts of Donegal Town.
                Our soccer club provides soccer coaching and games to age groups between U6’s right up through the age grades up to our senior men’s team. 
                We have recently added ladies football to our ranks in early 2020, with thanks to some of our wonderful coaches enthusiasm and the demand for ladies football in the locality. 
                It has been a major success in our first year & one we hope to add more age groups to in the near future.
                We like to involve the community as much as possible in our football club and we run an annual Inter Firms soccer competition every summer involving local businesses and teams from different sports codes. This has been a very successful fun event for over 20 years now and gets more people of all ages involved in our game and keeping active.
